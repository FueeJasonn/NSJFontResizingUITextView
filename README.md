# NSJFontResizingUITextView

## Problem

UITextField adjusts its font size dynamicaly with respect to is content, it can lower its font size upto a certain value set by the developer. The same requirement may arise for a UITextView where you have to set the content size of the UITextView constant and reduce the font size to view all the text in it without scrolling.
